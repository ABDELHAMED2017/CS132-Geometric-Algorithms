      "In this course we will study linear algebra.  Linear algebra is such a useful tool that it is crucially important to a number of areas in Computer Science.  If you study optimization, the starting point is linear algebra.  If you study computer graphics, the language you use every day is linear algebra.  If you study the performance of computer systems, you need linear algebra.  If you study algorithms -- especially graph algorithms -- you will absolutely need linear algebra.  If you study data mining, you will use linear algebra all the time.  And if you study quantum computing, the standard computations you use are in the language of linear algebra.\n",

      "The dominance of linear algebra arises because it is so fundamental, and in some ways, very simple.  It deals with objects that almost always can be interpreted geometrically.  So often we can use linear algebra in a very intuitive manner -- so much so that many times it is actually the best way to think about geometric problems.  But it is also rigorous and captures situations that sometimes we would overlook if we were proceeding purely intuitively.  This is because it is also about solving equations, and finding solutions to various kinds of problems.  So the advantage of being basic and fundamental is that it can be used and applied in so many ways."
